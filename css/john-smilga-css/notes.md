# MY NOTES

## CSS RULE
> selector { ... } 

## SELECTOR
- 

## { }
- declaration block

## LINE
- properties
- values
- declaration itself
- terminated with <strong>;</strong>
- <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>values</strong> are seperated by <strong>:</strong>

# IDS 
- IDS Need to be unique
- If repetition, we have to use classes
- (Note, there's no utility "ID" in Tailwind, just utility "classes")
- Grouping IDs
    > #title, #content

# CLASS
- Duplication
- can have both class and id over the same element
- can have multiple classes, but be it like this, <pre>class="class1 class2"</pre> inside HTML
