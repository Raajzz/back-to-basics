# MY NOTES

## CSS RULE
> selector { ... } 

## SELECTOR
- 

## { }
- declaration block

## LINE
- properties
- values
- declaration itself
- terminated with <strong>;</strong>
- <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>values</strong> are seperated by <strong>:</strong>

# IDS 
- IDS Need to be unique
- If repetition, we have to use classes
- (Note, there's no utility "ID" in Tailwind, just utility "classes")
- Grouping IDs
    > #title, #content

# CLASS
- Duplication
- can have both class and id over the same element
- can have multiple classes, but be it like this, <pre>class="class1 class2"</pre> inside HTML

# DIV AND SPAN

## DIV
- As you know, it's for grouping multiple elements together. 

## SPAN
- Span is used to group inline contents.

# OVERRIDING PROPERTIES

- All the properties will be passed to the child and applied unless the child overwrites it gives new properties. Some properties are not going to be inherited. For instance, if you apply border to body, the whole body will have border not each children of the body tag.

# LAST RULE

- Last value will be one that'll be used on our element.

# SPECIFICITY

    ID > CLASS > NAME-SELECTOR > *
